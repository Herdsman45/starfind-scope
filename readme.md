Dev mode:

```sh
# to initialize the repo and install dependencies
npm ci
# build - This builds the files in a "docs" folder, because I'm using Github Pages to deploy the app
npm run build
# dev-server - Use this in order to test locally
npm run serve
```

You must open localhost:9000 in the Alt1 browser and click the `add app` button that appears in order to get access to alt1 functionalities.

To deploy to Pages, you must run `npm run build` and push the docs, since that is the source of truth for Pages.
